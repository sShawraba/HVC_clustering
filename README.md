# HVC_clustering

Tabular data representing the morphological features of neurons in the HVC (RA and X) region in songbirds' brains was extracted from 3D confocal images of these neurons.
\newline
Unsupervised learning was then performed on the data to determine the subclasses of neurons in this region.
Methods used:
K-means
Guassian mixed model
Heirarchical clustering
